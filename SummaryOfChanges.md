# Summary of Changes

## Frontend

- Developed and updated the chat interface component for user interaction.
    - Utilized **Material-UI** for a modern and visually appealing design.
    - Error messages are displayed below the form in **red** for visibility, allowing users to quickly correct input errors.
    - Server errors are displayed in red within the chatbox, maintaining conversational flow and ensuring they are noticeable.
    - User and bot messages are styled distinctly to create a more organic chat experience.
    - Implemented input validation for enhanced user experience.
    - Added loading states for smoother chat interactions.
    - Validated input for empty queries, short queries, and incorrect measurement parameters to ensure usability.
    - Implemented comprehensive error handling for text validation, network errors, JSON validation, and unexpected issues.
    - Proactively handle failed query requests, eliminating the need for separate message error handling.
- Refactored the component structure to improve readability.
- Added comments throughout the code for easier understanding.

## Backend

- Implemented and updated the recommendation logic.
    - Introduced similarity calculations using **cosine similarity vectorization**.
    - Added a function to identify fit issues based on cosine similarity.
    - Selected **TfidfVectorizer** for text vectorization to account for word variability, including tense and root forms.
    - Restructured the "Common Issues" section for compatibility with cosine similarity and included `gore_floating`, which was present in the JSON file but missing from the code.
    - Developed a new function to generate recommendations based on issue similarity.
        - Sister fit recommendations are now informed by identified issues.
        - Confidence scores are based on both the similarity of identified issues and the similarity between the query and context description.
    - Avoided manual calculations based on assumptions, as a RAG or ML-based approach provides more accurate and meaningful recommendations.
- Enhanced error handling and logging for easier debugging, with specific handling for file and value input errors.
- Did not use LLMs for information processing, as those systems were deemed too costly and complex for this context.

## General

- The project structure remains unchanged.
- Improved code organization and documentation.
- Fixed various bugs and optimized performance.
- Updated dependencies and configuration files as necessary.
- Consistently prioritized code quality and readability.
- Worked within a four-hour time constraint to implement production-ready features.
- Tested with a wide range of input types and varied language to ensure robust handling of edge cases and out-of-context scenarios.
